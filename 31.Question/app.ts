//Explain & TIP: Before greeting users, check if there are any. This teaches you to handle empty arrays.

//let users :string [] = ["admin","aliyan","moiz","zahoor","ajmal"]

//if (users.length === 0) {
  //  console.log("we need to find some users!")
//}else{
  //for(let user of users) {
   //if(user ==="admin") {
    //console.log("Hello admin, would you like to see a status reports?") 
//} else {
  //  console.log (`Hello ${user},thank you for logging in again`)
//}
  //}
