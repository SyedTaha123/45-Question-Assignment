//Question 25: Alien Colors #1: Imagine an alien was just shot down in a game. Assign 'green', 'yellow', or 'red' to a variable called alien_color.
//Explain & TIP: Use an if statement to check the alien's color. This introduces you to simple conditionals.

// create a variable called alien_colour
let alien_colour: String = "green";

if(alien_colour == "green"){
    console.log("the player just earned 5 points.");

}

// write a program in which output failed

alien_colour = "red";
if(alien_colour == "green"){
    console.log("the player just earned 5 points.");
}
